## Presentation / Features

The "SSP Cloud" datalab is a service (hereinafter referred to as "the service") implemented by the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (hereinafter referred to as "Insee").

The SSP Cloud is an implementation of the open-source software [Onyxia](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia) created and maintained by the Innovation and Technical Instruction Division of Insee (Information System Direction/Innovation and Strategy Unit of the Information System). The SSP Cloud is hosted by Insee.

The SSP Cloud is a platform offering a "datalab" designed for data science experiments on open data, where users can orchestrate services dedicated to the practice of data science (development environments, databases, etc.). This service aims to familiarize users with new collaborative work methods involving open-source statistical languages (R, Python, Julia, etc.), cloud computing technologies, and to enable experimentation with innovative statistical processes. The offered services are standard.

The SSP Cloud is intended for French officials, as well as teachers and students of the Group of National Schools of Economics and Statistics, enabling interdepartmental collaboration and cooperation with their ecosystem. Access may also be granted upon request and with the approval of the governance bodies of the SSP Cloud to external collaborators involved in experimental projects of the public statistical system.

The SSP Cloud allows:

* orchestration of data science training
* access to data science services
* secure data storage
* management of secrets, such as encryption keys
* access to code management services
* orchestration of data processing flows

A user account also allows access to the platform of services of the Mutualization Inter-Ministerial Free Software Community ([https://groupes.mim-libre.fr/](https://groupes.mim-libre.fr/)).

## Terms of use of the service

The SSP Cloud datalab is accessible from any internet-connected browser. The use of a computer is recommended. The use of the datalab services is free of charge.

The user community is accessible on:

* Tchap, room [SSP Cloud](https://www.tchap.gouv.fr/#/room/#SSPCloudXDpAw6v:agent.finances.tchap.gouv.fr)
* Rocket Chat of MIM Libre, room [SSP Cloud](https://chat.mim-libre.fr/channel/sspcloud)

## Service usage limits

On the datalab, public data and usual data (non-sensitive work data) can be processed.

Storing any directly identifiable data (names, first names, etc.), even if already publicly available, is prohibited.

In the absence of specific authorization for a given experimental project, "protected" or "sensitive" data, with or without confidentiality markings intended to restrict distribution to a specific domain (statistical, commercial, industrial, etc.), cannot be processed on the datalab. The "protected" or "sensitive" nature of the information stored or processed on the datalab is subject to the user's discretion and the responsibility of their hierarchy.

St for tax control or economic repression purposes is prohibited.

## Roles, commitments, and associated responsibilities

The service is provided by Insee without any other express or implied warranties other than those provided herein. The service relies on open-source reference technologies. However, it is not guaranteed to be free from anomalies or errors. Therefore, the service is provided **without warranty of availability and performance**. In this regard, Insee cannot be held responsible for any losses and/or damages of any nature that may result from a malfunction or unavailability of the service. Such situations will not entitle the user to any financial compensation.

Each user has a personal storage space. By default, all information deposited in a user's storage space is accessible only to the user. Each user has the option to make files stored in their personal storage space public. Each user is responsible for making their files publicly available.

Each user acts under the responsibility of their hierarchy. They must ensure with their hierarchy that in the case of processing personal data using the SSP Cloud, these have been properly declared to the data protection officer of their administrative structure.

Each user commits, during their use of the platform, not to violate current legislative and regulatory provisions and these general terms of use. They are informed that any violation of these provisions may lead to legal proceedings and sanctions against them.

As the service's resources are shared among users, any excessive use may result in partial or total suspension of access to the service, without prior notice, at the discretion of the service administrators.

## Creating an account on the SSP Cloud

Access to the SSP Cloud requires prior registration and authentication. Registration and authentication can be done using the AgentConnect service.

## Experimental projects on non-open data

Upon decision of the governance bodies of the SSP Cloud, experimental projects involving non-open data may be conducted on the SSP Cloud. The decision specifies the authorized users to participate in these projects.

Participants in an experimental project involving non-open data must strictly adhere to the specific security rules for that project. They must use exclusively the collaborative spaces dedicated to the project and any necessary authorization procedures, particularly by the statistical secrecy committee.

## Intellectual property

### Intellectual property rights related to the platform

Insee holds all intellectual property rights related to the platform.

Users commit not to use the service in a manner that would constitute a violation or infringement of French laws and regulations.

### Intellectual property rights related to trademarks and logos

Insee holds the intellectual property rights to the visuals displayed on the platform.

These visuals cannot be used without the prior written authorization of Insee.

Any total or partial use or affixing of these visuals without the express and prior authorization of Insee is subject to the penalties provided for in Article L. 716-1 of the Intellectual Property Code.

### Intellectual property rights related to platform content

Some documents on the platform may be subject to intellectual property rights. Their reuse, in such cases, requires prior authorization from the rights holders.

## Obligations regarding data that users can deposit on the platform

The processing of personal data as defined in Articles 9 and 10 of the General Data Protection Regulation (racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, criminal convictions, past, present, or future health status, sexual orientation, sexual life, etc.) is prohibited on this Service.

Personal data processed in the context of an experiment carried out by a user, if any, falls under the responsibility of the administrative entity to which the user belongs. The provisions regarding their processing must be communicated by the user to the data protection officer of their administrative entity.

Each user commits to comply with the obligations arising from both the amended Law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978, relating to data processing, files, and freedoms, and Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 (General Data Protection Regulation).

Furthermore, the user agrees not to deposit any directly identifiable data on the platform. Therefore, only the deposit of data after at least pseudonymization is authorized. Any user implementing non-compliant processing will have their access to the service immediately revoked.

## Modification and evolution of the service

Insee reserves the right to evolve, modify, or suspend the service without notice for maintenance or any other reason deemed necessary. Information will be communicated to users via Tchap. The terms of these terms of use may be modified or supplemented at any time without notice, based on changes made to the service, changes in legislation, or for any other reason deemed necessary. These modifications and updates are binding on the user, who must therefore regularly refer to this section to check the current terms and conditions (accessible from the homepage).

## Applicable law - disputes

The service and these terms and conditions of use are subject to French law. In the event of a dispute, French courts will have jurisdiction.

## Contact

For technical and/or functional issues encountered on the platform, it is advisable, in the first instance, to seek assistance from peer communities in the collaborative spaces provided for this purpose on Tchap and Rocket Chat-MIM Libre.

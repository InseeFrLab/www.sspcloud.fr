# Introduction

In the world of data science and programming, having a flexible and reproducible training environment is essential. For educators and students alike, the ability to quickly set up consistent, ready-to-use environments is a game-changer. Onyxia excels at providing such environments. With just a simple link, users can launch pre-configured training environments, making it ideal for hands-on learning. This tutorial explains why SSP Cloud and notebooks are powerful tools for training, and how to structure and deploy an effective course using these technologies.

# Why use SSP Cloud for Training?

SSP Cloud allows users to deploy cloud-based workspaces easily, without the hassle of local installation or complex configuration. Here’s why it’s particularly useful for training:

1. **Instant Setup**: Instructors can share a link that configures everything—environment, software, and even datasets—so learners don’t need to install or configure anything locally.
2. **Consistency Across Learners**: By providing a reproducible environment, everyone works with the same configuration, minimizing setup issues that typically arise with different operating systems and dependencies.
3. **Scalability**: SSP Cloud can scale with your needs, offering powerful computing resources for large datasets or compute-intensive tasks. This allows it to support a wide range of training types, from beginner-level Python tutorials to advanced machine learning workflows.

Warning: SSPCloud does not provide formal service level agreements (SLAs) or guarantees regarding service availability. This means that users should be prepared for potential service interruptions or downtimes.
